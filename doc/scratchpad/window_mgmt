new window for every recipient of a message
whenever a new connection/chat/whatever is made through irc commands on ANY window, spawn a new window with chat for new recipient
this process should be synonymous to using gui commands

so we have a main window, listing all current chats and the rest of the main interface
then multiple windows, each with a specific chat
